## Monitoring Overview

Effective monitoring is essential for identifying issues, analyzing performance, and maintaining the overall health of our application. Prometheus and Grafana work together to provide a comprehensive monitoring solution.

## Prometheus

### What is Prometheus?

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It is particularly well-suited for dynamic environments like cloud infrastructure.

### How Prometheus Works

Prometheus follows a pull-based model, where it scrapes metrics from various targets at regular intervals. These targets could be your application instances, databases, or any other services. Prometheus stores these metrics in a time-series database, allowing for querying and analysis.

### Prometheus Configuration

The configuration of Prometheus is defined in a YAML file (`prometheus.yml`). This file specifies the targets to scrape, the intervals, and other settings.

Our `prometheus.yml` configuration:

```
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'com619-devops'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['20.117.224.131:9090']
```

## Grafana

### What is Grafana?

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides a customizable and feature-rich interface for visualizing metrics from various data sources, including Prometheus.

### Setting Up Grafana

To set up Grafana:

1. Install Grafana on a server or use a cloud-hosted Grafana service.
2. Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
3. Create dashboards to visualize key metrics.

### Grafana Dashboards

Our Grafana dashboards are tailored to provide insights into critical metrics, including response times, error rates, and resource utilization.

## Integration with Azure

### Azure Monitor

Integrate Prometheus with Azure Monitor to leverage Azure's native monitoring capabilities. This includes insights into the health and performance of Azure resources.

### Azure Alerts

Set up Azure Alerts to receive notifications based on predefined conditions. This enhances our ability to respond proactively to potential issues.
